        {\href{https://github.com/lundal/carp}{Cellular Automata Research Platform (Master's Thesis)}}
        {Aug 14 – Jun 15}
        {CARP is a platform for research on the potential of using bio-inspired massively parallel and distributed cellular automata to solve computing problems.
         It includes special-purpose hardware for use with artificial evolution and development, which are used to setup the cellular automaton.
         My contributions were a new PCIe communication interface and a complete overhaul of the entire platform to improve functionality, scalability, maintainability and efficiency.}

        {Jun 14 – Aug 14}
        {Helseappen is a demo-application for Microsoft's health initiative created by a team of 3 summer interns and one consultant at Mesan.
         It's purpose is to allow easier communication between patients and physicians and to enable more thorough follow-up.
         It targets the Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1 platforms, and technologies used include Microsoft Azure, REST, XAML and SQLite.
         My contributions were large parts of the front-end and some parts of the back-end.}

        {Aug 13 – Dec 13}
        {Barricelli is a specialized genetic algorithms computer designed and built by 10 students at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.
         It is designed to quickly find good approximations to hard problems using a custom-made hardware-accelerated generic genetic algorithm solver.
         My contributions were large parts of the FPGA design and implementation.}
