        {Aug 14 – Present}
        {CARP is a platform for researching the potential of using massively parallel cellular automata to solve computing problems in a radically different fashion.
         It includes special hardware for use with evolutionary algorithms, which are used in the process of programming the cellular automata.
        % Evolutionary algoritms are used program the cellular automata, and features for this is built directly into the platform.
         My contribution is a new PCIe communication interface and a complete rewrite of previous code to improve maintainability, extensibility and efficiency.}
        %{CARP is a platform for evolvable hardware research.
        % It consists of a configurable cellular automata and dedicated development and fitness modules implemented on an FPGA which is connected to a computer.
        % My contribution is a new PCIe communication module and a complete rewrite of old code to improve maintainability, add new features and fix errors.}
